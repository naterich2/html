        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm a college junior in Biomedical Engineering.  My favorite passtime is learning
          new things, I am very curious and always interested in learning about new things \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p>
        <p>This whole process has made me think critically about my alcohol use. I’ve always known there were risk associated with drink, such as the ones we talked about in our meeting, especially losing control of one’s decision making. I always knew making bad decisions is a real risk of getting drunk, but I never thought I got drunk enough to make stupid decisions I have never had an issue with making a bad decision from alcohol like I did that night, and this experience has made me realize it doesn’t have to be a bad decision I make that can end badly, but it can also be a good decision I don’t make that can cause fallout. This realization has definitely been the most impactful on me, because the level of intoxification that can cause me to not make a good decision is much lower than the level that would cause me to make a bad decision. It’s made me realize bad things can happen from a lower intoxification as well as from a higher one.

The most surprising statistic to me in the e-Checkup was definitely the number of students who get in trouble for alcohol problems. I expected it to be a fairly low number, around 5% of students. I thought this because not all students drink, and most students probably do not drink heavily enough to do anything that would get them in trouble. Secondly, I would have guessed the rate of being caught for something when someone is drunk enough to do something that could get them caught would be fairly low. The actual statistic is 17% of students which seems like a very large percentage to me. Maybe this number stems from what I said before, students who are not very drunk, but have lost enough control over themselves to not make a good decision, and end up getting caught for it.

The actual experience itself has been negative for me. I know what I did was wrong and I should have tried to stop my roommate more and obviously not incite him by filming, and then making it public. Thinking back to when the police officers said I can leave and what this would have been like if I had, this experience provided a fairly negative incentive to stay with him again. Regardless I would stay with him in the future because he needed it, it’s the right thing to do, and it’s in my values to help someone when they need it even at personal loss. I do,</p>
